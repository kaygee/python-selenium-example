Have fun automating things that are freely available on the internets using the Selenium Webdriver Python bindings.

## Slap Kirk

This little bit of Python automates the [Slap Kirk](http://www.slapkirk.com/play) site. The script has the capability of also saving the SPS (slaps per second) so you can attempt to optimize the code. Enjoy!
